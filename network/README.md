# Network Infrastructure

I try to setup my network infrastructure as what an business would setup so
that I can learn the more advanced functionality that comes with professional
equitment, this is an ongoing process and I will keep updating it when my
budget allows.

#### Current situation

The current situation looks like the image below where I have an old mesh
network built on two Asus ZenWIFI XT8 Mesh nodes that is currently handling all
my devices mostly wireless.

The exception is in my server room where I have run a Cat6 cable from one of
the XT8 nodes and then distribute it to all my homelab equitment, this has
worked fine for a couple of years but now I have multiple plans on expanding
the homelab during 2025 so I want also to make sure my network infrastructure
will not be a bottleneck.

#### Current goal

Here we can see what the current goal is, I have more plans for the future but
this is step 1.

Here we can see that we have replaced the Asus ZenWIFI XT8 mesh nodes with an
Ubiquiti Dream Machine Pro, that one is currently purchase and on it's way to
my place and should be here in the couple of days.

Then it has been added three UniFi U6 Pro AP's that will handle all the 
wireless devices in my house and also in my server room, in the beginning I will
use the Asus ZenWIFI XT8 nodes as AP's until I bought the Unifi AP's.

Due to the move to the Dream Machine we are now having most of the equitment in
the server room I also need to run two additional ethernet cables between the
house and the server room, in this process I will replace the current one with
an Cat6a and also for the two new once, this will be done in such a maner that
I can easly replace the cables to Cat7 or 8 when the time is right.
